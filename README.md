# Reflect with Obsidian

Obsidian is my journaling tool of choice, but sometimes I wish I could integrate LLMs into my journaling
to help structure my writing.

This plugin uses Claude to insert AI reflections whenever you need some third-party thought in your journal.

To enable the plugin, follow the [Obsidian docs](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin) and put this project in your plugins folder.

If you want a dedicated editor with this experience built-in, along with other AI features, check out this cool project I found: https://x.com/writewithprl (not affiliated)
